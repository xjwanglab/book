Code for 
[Artificial neural networks for neuroscientists: A Primer](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30705-4)

[Arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01001)

This repository provides tutorial-style code for training artificial neural networks on
simple neuroscience-relevant tasks, and for analyzing these networks using
a variety of neuroscience methods.

### Content

(1) [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gyyang/nn-brain/blob/master/ConvolutionalNetwork.ipynb)
 for training convolutional neural networks, representation-similarity-analysis (RSA),
and gradient-based tuning analysis.

(2) [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gyyang/nn-brain/blob/master/LSTMVisualization.ipynb)
for training LSTMs on a memory task, and visualizing neural activity.

(3) [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gyyang/nn-brain/blob/master/RNN%2BDynamicalSystemAnalysis.ipynb)
for training RNNs on a working memory task, and fixed-point-based dynamical system
analysis.

(4) [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gyyang/nn-brain/blob/master/EI_RNN.ipynb)
for training Excitatory-Inhibitory RNNs on a decision-making task, and analyzing
network connectivity.


### Requirements
This code is tested with Python 3 and a recent version of Pytorch. Please kindly
let me know if it does not work for you.
All code can be run quickly (a few minutes) on a laptop CPU.


Please email me at gyyang.neuro@gmail.com or send issues/pull requests, if
 you have any feedback. Thank you!
